        How does your parser handle invalid cron strings?

        Why does cron allow both day of week and day of month, and how does it behave if both are given?

        How would you extend this to support non-standard fields like seconds or named months?

        Could you make this parser reusable as a Python module for other projects?

        Can this logic be generalized for other interval expressions like ISO 8601 repeating intervals?

        What are the performance implications of your current approach?
